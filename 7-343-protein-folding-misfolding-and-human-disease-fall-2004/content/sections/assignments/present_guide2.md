description: This assignment will coincide with an oral presentation and will involve
  describing a technique utilized in the paper to be discussed that session. The technique
  should be described at a level geared to novices in the field and include a history
  of the procedure. The written description should include references and may involve
  diagrams if applicable. These technique descriptions will be copied and distributed
  to all members of the class, so at the end of the semester each student will have
  a "handbook" of techniques used in the protein folding field.
